# SFPC guide for note taking

In our sessions in New York, we always have teaching assistants whose tasks include note taking, supporting teachers in and outside of class, offering 1:1 office hours with students. Poetic Computation: Detroit is an exception as there is no teaching assistants. Instead of teaching assistants, we asked all teachers to participate in other teachers classes and assist. This was possible because most of the teachers came to Detroit from out of town, with an explicit goal of collaborating to make an immersive learning experience for themselves and the students.  

1. Check in with the teacher if they alreay have speakers notes and/ or slides. If they have most of their talks written out, it's not necesarry to transcribe everything they are saying. It's more important to take notes as a summary and highlight of their class. Effective notes are a mix of high level summary and detailed capture of conversations and interactions between students and teacher. 

2. The notes are used by students to review the class, find links 
If their slides are made available 
Share the slides wiht the students.

3. The notes are also used by the organizers to write daily blog postings. In a short, condensed program like Poetic Computation: Detroit, the notes play an essential role in documentation.

4. The fellow teachers and co-organizers, who are working to assist in class or note taking can offer feedback to the teachers. The feedback can be about content of the class or delivery. The teacher can also offer feedback to the producer and co-organizer
