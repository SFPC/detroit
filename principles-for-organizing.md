Principles for organizing School for Poetic Computation session in a remote location. 

This guide was written for the Poetic Computation: Detroit session in 2019. 

# 1. Community outreach 
- Be aware of our position as outsiders and colonial settlers. Be mindful of our privileges and responsbilities. Acknoledge the indigenous, traditional and local communities in the area. 
- Reach out to the local community members with care, follow up in correspondences. 
- Respect the people who have been doing similar work for a long time in the area. Never assume we have more expertise, or something new to offer. If anything, we can bring our genuine excitement and humble curiosity. 

# 2. Develop a curriculum specifically to the community 
- Consider the interest and needs of the community. What classes are available for them now and what's missing? 
- Build on top of the existing curriculum. What classes and resources from SFPC can we use?  

# 3. Explore a theme that's exciting to teachers 
- Build upon the existing relationship with teachers, 
- The theme Something new for the teachers. 
- Something that's relevant to the community 

# 4. Provide an equitable access to tools and knowledge 
- Understand the community's access to technology. Conduct a survey about their familiarity with technology.  
- Purchase the tools necesary for the session. Make a public documentation with the list of tools and set up.  
- Share class notes, slides and reading with acknowledgement to the original author and publisher. 

# 5. Positive experience for the teachers 
- Support travel, accomodation and daily stripend. Pay reasonable wage for teaching, provide technical and pedagogical support in preparation and for execution of the class.  
- Provide a clear expectation of work and contribution by a formal agreement. 
- Manage teachers schedules and responsbilities. Prevent burn out.   
#Diversity and inclusivity 

- Hiring process. Ask the first time teachers, who have an experience in creative work. Someone who can use this opportunity to grow as artist and teacher. Create a fair balance of gender, race and experience.  
- Admissions process. Prioritize the local community. In case of Detroit, we only admitted people who are based in Detroit and surrounding areas.  
- Understand the differernces between representation, visibility and tokenization. Representation of diversity begins by major decisions of locations of the program and teacher selections. Individuals, participants in the cohort, feel they have a visibility when they can have their voices heard. Make sure to carve out the time for the quiet, shy individuals. We need to avoid tokenization of the marginalized individuals. In order to help them feel comfortable and respected, we need to consider their individual needs prior to the event. They may have access needs, dietary restrictions, language and cultural needs. 


# Guide for stewardship of technology and knowledge
- Stewardship of technology is about being responsible and respectful for the resources. We are gifting all technology we purchased to the participants. We are asking them to sign an agreement for becoming a steward of the technology. The agreement asks, if they don't use it on a regular basis, they need to donate it to the Allied Media Project. 
- Stewardship of knowledge is about sharing the information and expertise with the community. We are providing a guide to run an educational program, like Poetic Computation: Detroit. We are asking all participants and community to run programs like this on their own.
