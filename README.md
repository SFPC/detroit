Poetic Computation: Detroit - 2019 
August 19 - 25, 2019 at Talking Dolls, Detroit 

### Open call

The [open call](http://sfpc.io/detroit) is live until July 1, 2019.

### Theme: Unconvering Technology 

To create a more meaningful relationship with technology, we will uncover technology’s glossy surfaces and look into its logic and beauty. SFPC’s Poetic Computation:Detroit will focus on the theme of Uncovering Technology. Together, we will learn the fundamentals of coding and critical theory in order to trace the contours of technology’s backbone. 

Technology is usually made available to us after many layers of abstraction have been imposed. In the process of abstraction, it’s inner workings are obscured and most people are excluded from understanding it. If we can’t understand it, we can’t fix it, take care of it or truly own it. What would it look like to cultivate a more caring and imaginative kind of tech for ourselves and each other?

Computers are one of the most intimate technologies we use on a daily basis. How would it feel if we changed our relationship to computers, from something we buy to something we make?  How would it feel to have a conversation with computers and write poetry with them? How would it feel to work with computers as collaborators and write software for our communities? 

Through lectures, field trips, and hands-on making, students will explore and respond to these ideas. During the one week session we will create several in-class projects and explore a balanced mix of technical, artistic, and theoretical content. Topics will include navigating computer with the command line, object oriented programming, electronics, and a critical theory of technology. SFPC’s Poetic Computation:Detroit is designed for someone without previous experience of coding to start having a more friendly, expressive and joyful relationship with technology.
