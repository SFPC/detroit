We also have really good spots to get a quick bite to eat in Hamtramck:
Royal Kabob - (Arabic)- best falafel sandwich in town and homemade labneh
Alladin - (Bengali)- best selection of naan, roti, paratha breads
Balkan House - hearty meat sandwiches in the best bread ever, also cheese burek 
Yemen Cafe - the root veggie fahsah cauldron w side bread is my fave for $8
Polish Village Cafe - our oldest restaurant, super atmospheric bavarian vibe in a basement. 
BonBonBon - femme chocolate shop - one piece is plenty!
