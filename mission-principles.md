# Mission and principles for organizing an off-site session

Mission statement and pedagogical principles for School for Poetic Computation session in a remote location. This guide was written by Taeyoon Choi with Melanie Hoff, Lauren Gardner, for the Poetic Computation: Detroit session in 2019. The guide can be edited for another location and community. 

# 1. Community outreach

We acknowledge our position as outsiders to Detroit. Because of our lack of context and community, we are mindful of our privileges and responsibilities. First, we want to acknowledge the indigenous, traditional and local communities in the area. To resist the settler colonialism, racism, sexism and ableism, we initiated diversity and inclusion effort by reaching out to local community stakeholders (prioritizing underrepresented communities of color) prior to the event. We built partnership with the people who have been doing similar work for a long time in the area.  

Approaches 

- Land acknowledgement (publicly mentioning the indigenous community in the region) in blog, class and public events. 
- Reach out and respond to the local community members with care and respect. 

# 2. Develop a curriculum for a specific community

We considered the interest and needs of the community. We researched the classes that are available for the local students now and what's missing. In Detroit, there are occupational software (coding and video editing) classes that are run by for profit schools, and a variety of non-profit organizations that offer accessible education. We decided to focus on artists, organizers and educator community and offer classes on creative technology, theory and social justice.  

Approaches 

- Build on existing curriculum from SFPC, offering software, physical computing and critical theory 
- Focus on tech literacy that exists as base layer in all hardware and software.  
- Develop skills that will enable students to understand computation across most devices. These are skills that are not specific to certain product, operating systems or programming language.
- Design a learning journey for students to scaffold new ideas and skills across classes. 

# 3. Explore a theme that's exciting to teachers

Based on our research trips, we spoke with our teachers and alums, and brainstormed the session’s theme. We wanted a new theme to motivate teachers to create something in response to the needs of the Detroit community.  For example, Ann’s inquiry into ‘power’ in addition to her labor organizing was an exciting fit for Detroit. Melanie’s ‘Folder Poetry’ was a good example of explaining base elements of how a computer works while working within the constraints of a Raspberry Pi. We wanted to express to the students that learning computation is not a means to an end. With the theme of Uncovering Technology, we designed a curriculum that supports students to be empowered with creative expression, independence and experimentation. 

Approaches:

- Create a collaborative classes by pairing teachers. 
- Organize semi-regular meetings with teachers to build a cohesive curriculum. 
- Ask teachers to fulfill three expectations when developing class ideas.  
    a. Teach something they are excited about 
    b. Involve technology in some capacity  
    c. Design a class assignment for an outcome ready for public showcase  

# 4. Provide equitable access to tools and knowledge

During our research phase, we tried to understand potential students access to technology. We conducted a survey about their familiarity with technology and their current access to computers or laptops. We then conducted multiple info sessions and workshops in multiple spaces in Detroit. What we learned from our survey and in person from the workshops helped define our classroom and tools. Upon research, we made a confident decision to use Raspberry Pis as a learning tool for the students and as a framework for curriculum. 

It’s not enough to provide the tools and lessons. In order to create a safe environment for participants to share thoughts and ask questions. We acknowledged the expertise of participants through ice breaking activities before class started through a welcome BBQ. This experience provided an environment that helped to facilitate equitable knowledge sharing between students and teachers throughout the week. Our goal was to start building community in Detroit. We recognize the knowledge implicit in the community and wanted participants to introduce themselves properly.

Approaches: 

- Sourcing: Research, prototype and testing of potential hardware. Purchase tools necessary for the session. 
- Set up Raspberry Pi for all classes. In our case, it took 6 days of two teachers work. 
- Make public documentation with the list of tools and set up for future organizers. Read the set up guide for reference.   
- Share class notes, slides and reading with acknowledgement to the original authors and publishers. Make digital and physical copies for students. 
- Provide opportunities for participants to build connections from our program 
- Finding a space that we feel ownership of. Finding a host, Talking Dolls, who is responsive and present like a partner and not a landlord. This reverberated down through the students as well making them feel comfortable. 

# 5. Positive experience for the teachers and organizers

It is hard for teachers to deliver their work to a new audience and in an environment where they have less control. Our aim was to fully support the logistics of their travel and accommodation so they could focus on their class. We did this by providing a daily stipend, paying a reasonable wage for teaching, provide technical and pedagogical support in preparation and for execution of the class. We hired four organizers and seven teachers, who shared a housing and two cars. 

We did not plan well for note taking during class. This became extra work for teachers who were on site but not currently teaching. We did not clearly articulate the expectation for organizers to plan the logistics and transportation of the cohort. Organizers had to be adaptive to the remote location and unforeseeable contingencies. We initially planned for teachers to be present during all classes, co-learning with students. This was an unreal expectation as teachers needed more down time.

Approaches:

- Provide a clear expectation of work and contribution by formal agreement.
- Have enough support (administration and facilitation) and manage individual schedules and responsibilities evenly between organizers to prevent burn out and accidents.
- Offer private rooms and personal down time, support dietary and accessibility requirements.  
- Pay teachers per-diem before trip to cover their expenses on site.
- Encourage work-talk or planning conversations during specific times so participants can also enjoy each other in a more personal and fun way.

# 6. Diversity and inclusivity

The School for Poetic Computation’s mission prioritizes diversity and inclusion (D&I) of marginalized communities in the art and technology field, especially women, LGBITQ and disability community. For Poetic Computation: Detroit, we considered D&I in both our hiring process and student selection. 

We asked veteran teachers who have the experience to offer a quality learning experience and first time teachers with experience in creative work, who can use this opportunity to grow as artist and teacher. We reached out to a number of Detroit-based artists, designers and activists asking if they wanted to lead a class or workshop session but did not have much response. We think the low response rate is due to running the program for the first time in Detroit. We are lucky to have our organizational partners, Talking Dolls and Detroit Community Technology Project, who offered to teach and help us with outreach.  Most of the out of town teachers in Poetic Computation: Detroit are alums of the School for Poetic Computation. The advantage of working with our alums include building upon institutional knowledge and expanding the community. 

We considered D&I in the admissions process.  In case of Detroit, we prioritized applicants who are based in Detroit and surrounding areas. We asked how the applicants identify with their gender, race and disability in the open call. We had a sliding scale tuition from $0 to 500, supporting students of all economic background can attend the session. 

Approaches: 

- Aim to create a fair balance of gender, race and experience. 
- Balance the local and remote teachers.  
- Prioritize the local community by asking students to list their zip code in the application.
- Create and enforce Code of Conduct for D&I. 

# 7. Representation and visibility

Understand the differences between representation, visibility and tokenization. Representation is when our potential students can see themselves in the teachers and facilitators of the program. Visibility is when our students have equal voice and space in the program. Tokenization occurs when visibility is not provided in spite of representation. We want to avoid that at all costs. There is no one way to have a fair representation and visibility. It's a constant work in progress, iterative process that requires the work of everyone involved in the program.

Approaches: 

- Decide a location that aligns with our core mission of providing access to tech education to underreprented communities 
- Make sure teachers and facilitators represent the diversity of the prospective students.
- Make they can have their voices heard. Make sure to carve out the time for the quiet, shy individuals.
- Try to avoid tokenization of the marginalized individuals by asking their individual needs prior to the event. This includes, dietary restrictions, sensitivity to certain language and cultural references

# 8. Guide for stewardship of technology and knowledge

Inspired by a talk from [Vanessa German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanessa_German), we recognize that we are an outside organization with access to funds and resources that the local community does not have. If we bring in a resource, we don’t want to leave with that resource creating a vacuum for the students who could continue their learning if that technology was left in their hands. We wanted to leave behind the tools and acknowledge the responsibility of being stewards of that resource.

We gifted all technology to students and asked them to understand the responsibility for stewardship of the technology. We taught about our shared responsibility to respectful for the resources, acknowledge the material and financial consequences of technology. We also asked if they don't use it on a regular basis, they need to donate it to the Allied Media Project.  
Stewardship of knowledge is about sharing the information and expertise with the community.

Approaches 

- Before gifting the technology, request a plan for use of the technology, for creative work and teaching other people in their community. 
- Provide a donation options for them when they are not using them. 
- Ask participants to use the technology to run programs like this on their own.
- Ask participants to sign an agreement for becoming a steward of the technology.
- Provide the curriculum for students to run an educational program, like Poetic Computation: Detroit.  

# 9. Produce tangible outcomes 

The most important outcome is providing a positive learning experience of the students and raise awareness about poetic computation in Detroit. This is a hard metric to quantify as individual experiences are personal. We want to encourage the students, their communities and others to engage with poetic computation and we try to capture learning process, student work and their thoughts along the way to grow awareness of studying technology through artistic exploration.

Approaches

- Conduct interviews with students and final survey. 
- Public events of Salon and Showcase. Open invitation to everyone in the community. We keep track of the result with photo, video documentation. These are community events for the larger public. 
- Publish  a zine that includes student works, class notes and participant responses.

# 10. Next steps & takeaways

We were excited about the opportunity to work with a new community but we under estimated the amount of time and effort it would take to produce a session remotely. It took longer to find teachers and students in Detroit because we did not have deep local connections already made. We also had to plan an additional research trip to scout locations for the on-site program.

- Do not promise another session unless we've secured funding and logistical requirements. 
- Be clear about our capacities as individuals and a collective. 
- Communicate about ways in which the participants can help make the next session possible. 
- Support the participants to self-organize local meet ups and workshops.
- Thank all the local partners, collaborators and contributors. Share our outputs with them.
- Produce a final report for funders that can act as an organizing guideline for future organizers. 
- Document our curriculum and a project archive. Share the documents openly so it can be re-used.
