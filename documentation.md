# D: Summary 

We experienced a strong need and interest for an inclusive art and tech community and learning opportunities in Detroit. In order to provide equitable access, we (art and tech teachers and organizers) need to support cities other than NY, SF or LA, build relationships with local organizers and support the local community. We created a [mission statement](https://github.com/SFPC/detroit/blob/master/mission-principles.md) for organizing an off-site session. We hope the documentation and mission statement can be a tool for future organizers to adapt and develop for their local community.
